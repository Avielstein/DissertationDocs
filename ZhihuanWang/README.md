## Ph.D. thesis, Zhihuan Wang

+ [Final PDF](thesis.pdf?raw=true)

In my thesis I made use of the standard Drexel Dissertaion style file
`drexel-thesis.cls` including deluxetable. The `yahapj.bst` file makes it so
the references are properly hyperlinked to their ads/arXiv pages. But for the
general purpose of the reference style, I used `ieeetr` style.

In addition to my thesis I have also included my presentation slides. These
were also made in latex (using beamer), and in them I made heavy use of tikz, a
package that allows you to annotate basic shapes onto the slides. The commented
`\draw[help lines,xstep=.1,ystep=.1] (0,0) grid (1,1);` lines will draw a
series of grid lines on the slide to help with positioning. I only included one
working example of the presentation with a few slides, which works as a
demonstration of how to use beamer to generate presentation slides if you are
interested in. However, I have my major slides built by Powerpoint which is not
included in this repo.

## Drexel Dissertation for Dimensional Dipendence of Light Interaction with Nanowire

#### Abstract

> Semiconductor nanowires have been used in a variety of passive and active
optoelectronic devices including waveguides, photodetectors, solar cells, LEDs,
Lasers, sensors, and optical antennas. We review the optical properties of
these  nanowires in terms of absorption, guiding, and radiation of light, which
may be termed light management. Analysis of the interaction of light with long
cylindrical structures with sub-wavelength diameters identifies radial resonant
modes, such as Leaky Mode Resonances, or Whispering Gallery modes. The
two-dimensional treatment should incorporate axial variations in volumetric
modes which have so far been presented in terms of Fabry-Perot, and Helical
resonance modes. We report on FDTD simulations with the aim of identifying the
dependence of these modes on: geometry (length, width), tapering, shape
(cylindrical, hexagonal), core-shell versus core-only, and dielectric cores
with semiconductor shells. This demonstrates how NWs form excellent optical
cavities without the need for top and bottom mirrors. However, optically
equivalent structures such as hexagonal and cylindrical wires can have very
different optoelectronic properties meaning that light management alone does
not sufficiently describe the observed enhancement in upward (absorption) and
downward transitions (emission) of light in nanowires; rather, the electronic
transition rates should be considered. We discuss this rate-management scheme
showing its strong dimensional dependence, making a case for photonic
integrated circuits that can take advantage of the confluence of the desirable
optical and electronic properties of these nanostructures.
