This thesis is dedicated to my family. Their unconditional support and love was
the foundation of success for my graduate study. I want you to know that I love
you so much and this thesis was only possible thanks to you.

%Over the past six years I have received support and encouragement form many
    %people.

This dissertation summarized the research work I have accomplished during my
graduate study in Drexel University. Over all these years, I obtained
tremendous help from all the people around and I cannot leave the dissertation
without expressing my gratitude to them.

This work would not have been possible without the support of my advisor, Dr.
Bahram Nabet. His guidance helped to shape and provided much needed focus to my
work.  I would also like to thank my dissertation committee of Dr. Timothy Kurzweg,
Dr. Baris Taskin, Dr. Nagarajan Kandasamy, and Dr. Goran Karapetrov for their
support and insight throughout my research.

Many thanks to our generous collaborators, Dr. Adriano Cola, Dr. Anna Persano,
Dr. Paola Prete at IMM-NCR in Italy, Dr. Nico Lovergine at University of
Salento in Italy and Dr. Marc Currie from Navel Research Laboratory in
Washington D.C. for their tremendous efforts in fabrication of the AlGaAs/GaAs
core-shell nanowires and electro-optically sampling, micro-photoluminescence
measurements of the devices. Although, I have not had the opportunity of
meeting them yet, it is still a great pleasure to communicate with them in
Email and I appreciate their valuable thoughts and discussions in many of the
experimental results. I would also like to dedicate many thanks to Dr. Fernando
Camino, Dr. Aaron Stein, Dr. Chang-Yong Nam, Dr. Mircea Cotlet and many other
staffs at CFN of Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long Island for their
assistance and suggestions in characterizing the devices.

I would also like to thank my friends in the Photonics Lab for all the help and
support they provided, and especially for providing such a friendly and awesome
place to work and study at. Pouya Dianat, Weston Aenchbacher and Shrenik Vora
have spent countless hours listening to me talk about my research, helping me
flesh out my ideas. And a special thanks to Jiajia Liu for accompanying me
during all these years and bringing countless happiness to my life.

Finally, my parents deserve my most sincere gratitude. I appreciate you spent
one or two months each year to be in the states with me, and they always
believe in, encourage and love me even when they live on the other side of the
earth.

Semiconductor nanowires have been used in a variety of passive and active
optoelectronic devices including waveguides, photodetectors, solar cells, LEDs,
Lasers, sensors, and optical antennas. We have designed and fabricated
GaAs/AlGaAs core-shell nanowires (CSNWs) grown on both GaAs and Si substrates
by vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) method. These nanowires show extremely enhanced
optical properties in terms of absorption, guiding, radiation of light, and
even lasing. Analysis of the interaction of light with cylindrical and
hexagonal structures with sub-wavelength diameters identifies both transverse
plane modes and longitudinal plane modes in a generalized volumetric resonance
modes without the need for vertical structures such as Bragg mirrors commonly
used in vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL's). We report on FDTD
simulations with the aim of identifying the dependence of these modes on:
geometry (length, width), tapering, shape (cylindrical, hexagonal), core-shell
versus core-only, and dielectric cores with semiconductor shells. This
demonstrates how NWs form excellent optical cavities without the need for top
and bottom mirrors. However, optically equivalent structures such as hexagonal
and cylindrical wires can have very different optoelectronic properties meaning
that light management alone does not sufficiently describe the observed
enhancement in upward (absorption) and downward transitions (emission) of light
in nanowires; rather, the electronic transition rates should be considered. We
discuss how the transition rates change with respect to electron distribution
and identify three factors explicitly contributed to the transition rates with
strong dependence on dimensionality. In addition, a CSNW based laser has been
proposed and modeled, showing large increase in optical gain and quantum
efficiency compared to their bulk counterparts. These results and findings will
further facilitate the design and optimization of sub-micron scale
optoelectronic devices. In conclusion, we make a case for photonic integrated
circuits that can take advantage of the confluence of the desirable optical and
electronic properties of these nanostructures.
