Semiconductor nanowires have been used in a variety of passive and active
optoelectronic devices including waveguides, photodetectors, solar cells, LEDs,
Lasers, sensors, and optical antennas. We review the optical properties of
these  nanowires in terms of absorption, guiding, and radiation of light, which
may be termed light management. Analysis of the interaction of light with long
cylindrical structures with sub-wavelength diameters identifies radial resonant
modes, such as Leaky Mode Resonances, or Whispering Gallery modes. The
two-dimensional treatment should incorporate axial variations in volumetric
modes which have so far been presented in terms of Fabry-Perot, and Helical
resonance modes. We report on FDTD simulations with the aim of identifying the
dependence of these modes on: geometry (length, width), tapering, shape
(cylindrical, hexagonal), core-shell versus core-only, and dielectric cores
with semiconductor shells. This demonstrates how NWs form excellent optical
cavities without the need for top and bottom mirrors. However, optically
equivalent structures such as hexagonal and cylindrical wires can have very
different optoelectronic properties meaning that light management alone does
not sufficiently describe the observed enhancement in upward (absorption) and
downward transitions (emission) of light in nanowires; rather, the electronic
transition rates should be considered. We discuss this rate-management scheme
showing its strong dimensional dependence, making a case for photonic
integrated circuits that can take advantage of the confluence of the desirable
optical and electronic properties of these nanostructures.
