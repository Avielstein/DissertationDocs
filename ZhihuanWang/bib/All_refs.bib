Here the authors describe polarization dependence and also dimensionality. {\textquotedblleft} The main results in the present calculations are the existence of pronounced absorption peaks at exciton resonances and the structure dependent anisotropic properties of these absorption peaks. The polarization dependences of the absorption spectra are discussed in relation to the valence band mixing. The enhanced excitonic absorption found by the numerical calculations, as well as markedly suppressed band-to-band absorption, are explained in terms of electron-hole Coulomb interaction.{\textquotedblright}}
